[FIXED]TileSamplerZ:
The shader code uses 8 uniformSamplers. These are initialised in a map from parsing the shader code. But all 8 are not allways used, and when attachin a TileStorage with less than 8 textures, the remaining uniformSamplers are not sets. This generates an error when checking samplers from MeshBuffers.cpp. I don't think this is an issue though, and the error can possible be ignored until further, but this issue should be fixed.

[FIXED]Terrain3 example:
Terrain3 crashes. TweakBarManager crashes. So does the view controller/ui when tweakbar manager is not attaced and mouse is moved. This is not related to the ortho producer, which works fine in the simplified terrain3_simplified example (removed BasicViewhandler and ui/twbarmanager). 
Update: Stripped tweakbar only, and implemented basicViewHandler in the example, which works very well. The crash is then down to TweakBarManager and related classes. TW version 1.16 is tested in itself with all examples, and works very well, so there is something with the Proland implementation. Maybe because TWB uses old OpenGL?
Update2: Tested new example core/twbartest, only to open a twbar. Results in the same messages...
Update/FIX: Change TwInit to use OPEN_GL_CORE instead of OPEN_GL
