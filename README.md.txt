This project is a clone of Inria's Proland:
[Proland home page](http://proland.imag.fr/)

Introduction
Proland is a C++/OpenGL library for the real-time rendering of multi-resolution terrains (up to whole planets), 
the real-time management and edition of vector data (representing for instance roads or rivers),
 the rendering of atmosphere and clouds, the rendering and animation of the oceans, and the rendering of forests. 
 All data are loaded or generated on the fly according to the viewpoint, and can be combined procedurally. 
 For instance the shape and texture of a terrain can be modified using vector data representing roads and rivers.

Proland uses the Ork rendering library. 

Background
Dying to Proland project is nolonger maintained and the binary released is always running failed because of shader compiling version;Besides,the source code project is building using codeBlocks
without dependency libs;So this project change the build system to visual studio 2017 with all dependencies.
